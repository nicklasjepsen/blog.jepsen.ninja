# Using IHttpClientFactory in Azure Functions

Are you using `HttpClient` in your .net projects as well as Azure Functions as general .net projects?
That is awesome, however, in this post I am going to talk about the [IHttpClientFactory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.ihttpclientfactory), what benefits you gain from using it, how to use it and why I think it's a good idea to do so.

## A word about Dependency Injection

To use `IHttpClientFactory` in you code, you should be using DI to inject it (and any other class dependencies your code have). DI is a subject in it self and I wont go too much in details about the benefits of it in this post, instead head over to [this Microsoft article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection) if you want to learn more about it.
I also wrote an article about DI in Azure Functions which this article is building on:

## So why use IHttpClientFactory?

First, when we need to make an `HTTP` request in our code, we very often need to send some additional data in that request, like for instance sending some specific `HEADER` values. If we don't use the `IHttpClientFactory` then we would need to create a new `HttpClient` everytime we need to do a `HTTP` request and then we also need to add the `HEADER`. This can lead to a lot of code duplication, which in my opinion is one of the things that we, as developers, should seek to limit as much as possible, because duplication is the root of all sorts of evil things like unexpected bugs, low maintainability and so on. So to avoid that, please read on!

## Coding time!

Now lets get to the fun stuff. Here's what we need to do to have an Azure Function that is able to make `HTTP` requests using an injected `HttpClient`:

1. Create a HTTP Triggered Azure Function project
2. Add additional Nuget packages
3. Add Startup.cs
4. Modify function .cs files

### Creating the project

This one is easy > fire up VS > File > New > Azure Function > Select HTTP Trigger

### Adding the Nugets

This one is also covered in [my previous article](https://blog.jepsen.ninja/dependency-injection-in-azure-functions), but here are the relevant packages to install:

```ps1 PowerShell
Install-Package Microsoft.Extensions.Http -Version 3.1.14
```

```ps1
Install-Package Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection -Version 3.1.14
```

```ps1
Install-Package Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Extensions -Version 1.1.0
```

```ps1
Install-Package Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions -Version 3.0.11
```

> If you want to deploy to Azure then stick with the version 3.x of the 2 first packages, as there is not full natively support for .net 5 yet.

### Add Startup.cs

Our initial Function project do not contain any `Startup.cs` and since this is the place where all the magics happens, we need to add that, so at the root of our project, add a new class: Startup.cs.
We will start by just injection the `HttpClient`directly so add this snippet to your `Startup.cs`:

```cs
using Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

[assembly: FunctionsStartup(typeof(Blog.Jepsen.Ninja.Startup))]

namespace Blog.Jepsen.Ninja
{
    public class Startup : FunctionsStartup
    {
        public override void Configure(IFunctionsHostBuilder builder)
        {
            builder.Services.AddHttpClient();
        }
    }
}
```

### Modify your function file

When using DI, we inject the objects we need into our classes using the constructor. The default function class is marked `static` and a `static` class cannot have a constructor. We therefore need to make a few adjustments to the generated function class:

1. Remove the `static` keyword from the class definition
2. Remove the `static` keyword from the method definition
3. Add a constructor that takes the `HttpClient` as a parameter
4. Add a `readonly` field to the function class to hold the `HttpClient`

Now your function class should look something like this:

```cs
public class HttpTriggerFunction
{
    private readonly HttpClient httpClient;
    public HttpTriggerFunction(HttpClient httpClient)
    {
        this.httpClient = httpClient;
    }
    [FunctionName("HttpTriggerFunction_InjectedClient")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> HttpTriggerFunction_InjectedClient(
        [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
        ILogger log)
    {
        var url = "https://blog.jepsen.ninja";
        var sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();
        var response = await httpClient.GetAsync(url);
        return new OkObjectResult($"{url} returned {response.StatusCode} in {sw.ElapsedMilliseconds}ms.");
    }
}
```

That's it - now you are ready to test your function out, run it, browse to the url listed in the console, usually it's something like:

```http
http://localhost:7071/api/HttpTriggerFunction
```

And the response should look like this:

```Shell
https://blog.jepsen.ninja returned OK in 228ms.
```

## Using different `HttpClient` instances

Now to truly benefit from the `IHttpClientFactory` injection we are going to make a few modifications. In this example we are going to add a custom `User-Agent` based on the function. This is just for demonstration purposes, in real life, we could have different `HttpClient` instances for authenticated and none authenticated request. We could have different instances for different external services we were depending on, and so forth. 

If we were to just use a single `HttpClient` per class, we can just add the following to our `Startup.cs`

```cs
services.AddHttpClient<ISomeService, SomeService>();
```

However, we want to have different `HttpClient` instances in the same function class, so we need to inject the `IHttpClientFactory`.

Modify `Startup.cs`:

```cs
public override void Configure(IFunctionsHostBuilder builder)
{
    builder.Services.AddHttpClient();
    builder.Services.AddHttpClient("blog", c =>
        {
            c.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://blog.jepsen.ninja");
            c.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("User-Agent", "Blog.Jepsen.Ninja.Functions");
        });
}
```

Then in your functions class do the following:

1. Modify the construtor to also take a `IHttpClientFactory`
2. In the constructor, get the `HttpClient` instance by calling `CreateClient` and pass the name
3. Assignt the client to a class field
4. Add another function method to use the new `HttpClient`

Doing so, your function file should look like this:

```cs
 public class HttpTriggerFunction
 {
     private readonly HttpClient httpClient;
     private readonly HttpClient blogClient;
     public HttpTriggerFunction(IHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory, HttpClient httpClient)
     {
         this.httpClient = httpClient;
         blogClient = httpClientFactory.CreateClient("blog");
     }

     [FunctionName("HttpTriggerFunction_InjectedClient")]
     public async Task<IActionResult> HttpTriggerFunction_InjectedClient(
         [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
         ILogger log)
     {
         var url = "https://blog.jepsen.ninja";
         var sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();
         var response = await httpClient.GetAsync(url);
         return new OkObjectResult($"{url} returned {response.StatusCode} in {sw.ElapsedMilliseconds}ms.");
     }

     [FunctionName("HttpTriggerFunction_NamedHttpClient")]
     public async Task<IActionResult> HttpTriggerFunction_NamedHttpClient(
 [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
 ILogger log)
     {
         var sw = Stopwatch.StartNew();
         var response = await blogClient.GetAsync(string.Empty);
         return new OkObjectResult($"{blogClient.BaseAddress} returned {response.StatusCode} in {sw.ElapsedMilliseconds}ms.");
     }
 }
```

Now run the project, and you will see 2 endpoints showing:

```Shell
HttpTriggerFunction_InjectedClient: [GET] http://localhost:7071/api/HttpTriggerFunction_InjectedClient

HttpTriggerFunction_NamedHttpClient: [GET] http://localhost:7071/api/HttpTriggerFunction_NamedHttpClient
```

We can then inspect the `HttpRequest` using Fiddler and verify that our `User-Agent` is set correctly in the second method:

## Wrapping up

That is it for todayÂ´s `HttpClient`/`HttpClientFactory` tutorial. As you can see, there are many benefits from using DI together with `HttpClient`. This articled focused on how to use it in an Aure Function, but you can of course use this approach in any .NET project running the latest .net version.
